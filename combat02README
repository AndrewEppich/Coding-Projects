#I wanted to make the game smoother that the first one I made. I wanted to use more functions and variables so what was printed
#was based on the user and not what I pre coded in to print. I also like using the time functions to make it feel 
#more like a video game by pausing to let the player read. One thing I couldn't quite get past was a re occuring errors with
# the dice rolling and damage calculating function. I'm not really sure how to fix it and I'vd tried everything I can think of
# im hoping my partner for the quiz knows what im doing wrong and can give me feedback to fix it
