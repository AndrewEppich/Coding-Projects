#I wanted to make my code feel like it was really a video game. That is why I put a a lot of text at the start explaining
#charecters and the opponent. I also used time.sleep to give it a real video game feel with pauses. I used a while loop and 
# a lot of if statements for when the user decided to attack or dodge and whether the npc attacked or dodged.
# I used the sets and -= to change the health of the user and the npc. I also used the set for the damage modifier
# for when the user or npc dodged. I used an if statement with break to end the loop at declare defeat when either the user
# or the npcs health went below zero
